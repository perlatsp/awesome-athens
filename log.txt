Και πώς θα γίνει αυτό; Εύκολα!</p> <p>GitLab, Docker containers, Registries, Helm και Kubernetes θα ακουστούν πολύ, οπότε σας περιμένουμε την Παρασκευή 16 Φεβρουαρίου και ώρα 18:45, στα γραφεία της Microsoft Hellas (Κηφισίας 221) στο Μαρούσι, να τα συζητήσουμε όλα από κοντά!</p> <p>Πρόγραμμα<br/>18:45 - 20:00<br/>Setting up a CI/CD pipeline with Gitlab &amp; Kubernetes.<br/>After pushing to Gitlab, code is transforming into docker images, stored in a registry, pulled by Helm and deployed as pods in Kubernetes.

And make no mistake, infinite streams are all around us, even though we are used to splitting them into artificial segments (batches) to simplify how we process them.</p> <p>The problems that can be solved this way include:</p> <p>• log joining pipelines<br/>• session-based analysis for search, ads, analytics, social, and YouTube<br/>• billing pipelines<br/>• aggregate statistics calculations<br/>• abuse detection pipelines<br/>• recommendation generation</p> <p>But most of all, what I found especially interesting about this paper was that it gave me the mental tools to frame the data processing problem and its various nuances. All in all, I think it should make for an interesting topic!</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Nikos Fertakis is a software engineer, and a tech lead of Skroutz\'s Search team. He holds a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Athens, and an MSc in Machine Learning from University College London.</p> <p>Details</p> <p>Doors open at 6:30pm; the presentations will begin around 7pm.</p> <p>The talk will be in Greek, unless there are non-Greek speakers in the audience. In that case the talk can be in English.</p> <p>Enter the building from the entrance right beside the parking lot and climb to the second floor.</p> <p>After the presentation we will open the floor to discussion and questions.</p> <p>We hope you will read the paper before the meetup, but don\'t stress if you can\'t. If you have any questions please add them on this event\'s thread.</p> <p>We have a Github repo which we use for coordinating Papers We Love Athens: <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/athens" class="linkified">https://github.com/papers-we-love/athens</a> We will be opening an issue before each meetup to serve as a space for Call for Presentations.
